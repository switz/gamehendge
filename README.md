## What is this

A friend of mine shoots a lot of drone photography. He wanted a simple tool that he can use in the field to quickly map image exif GPS data to a map so he can be sure no photos corrupted before heading home.

Visit https://saewitz.com/gamehendge to use this application.

Click "Choose Files" and select multiple images w/ exif data. It'll place red dots onto the map. Refresh the page if you want to start fresh.

That's it. That's all it does. Nothing more.
